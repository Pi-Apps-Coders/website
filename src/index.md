# Get involved

You don't need to be a programmer to help!  
- The easiest way to help is by "Starring" our repository - it helps more people find Pi-Apps.
- If you know somebody else who has a Raspberry Pi (or other ARM Linux Device), feel free to tell them about Pi-Apps. We would offer you a referral discount, but Pi-Apps is free, so... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- You can [make suggestions](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=suggestion.yml), [report bugs](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml), or [suggest apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=app-suggestion.yml).
- You can [create and submit an app](/wiki/development/Creating-an-app/). Don't worry, it's about as easy as using the terminal (and it's even easier if you're submitting a simple apt-package)! Just make sure it fits our [app eligibility rubric](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/185) first!
