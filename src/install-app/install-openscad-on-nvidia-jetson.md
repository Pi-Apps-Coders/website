> OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.

> Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
> the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
> OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
> perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.
> 
> OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
> a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
> and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
