> Speeds up web browsing thanks to cloud servers.
> This web browser uses cloud servers to load websites for you, instead of making your system do it all. Result: a claimed 1600% browsing speed increase.
> Please note that Puffin is a pretty bad browser now, and uses such an old Google Chrome that it fails to load many common websites correctly. Additionally, Puffin's cloud servers can probably see everything you are looking at, so try to avoid giving it any sensitive data.
> Puffin is probably best used sparingly only on systems with low RAM, such as the Pi Zero 2 or Pi 3. It can also be useful for reaching websites forbidden by your local network, since browsing traffic is handled on Puffin's servers.

> Also don't be surprised if we at Pi-Apps decide to remove Puffin in the future. But for now it still works on 64-bit ARM systems at least. (32-bit support broke in late 2024)

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
**Puffin will only run on PiOS 64-bit.** Pi-Apps will not let you install Puffin on PiOS 32-bit.
