> This is a Chinese clone of Microsoft Office.
> It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, a PDF viewer, and a web browser. It appears to be free software and you don't need to create an account to use it.
> Compared to LibreOffice, WPS Office runs faster, looks better, and seems to be more stable.
> 
> This script will prevent the program from connecting to the Internet, just in case it contains telemetry or spyware.
> 
> To run: Menu -> Office -> WPS Office
> To run in a terminal: it depends! Please read the information below.
> 
> This app installs differently, depending on if you are using a 32-bit OS or a 64-bit OS.
> If you are using a 32-bit OS:
> - You will have to enable the 64-bit kernel. Don't worry, enabling it will not harm your OS - you probably won't even notice.
> - A 64-bit Debian Bullseye chroot will be created. (/opt/wps-office-chroot)
> - The total installation will take 2.1GB of space.
> - To run in a terminal: schroot -c wps-office-chroot -- wps
> - If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, then run this command: sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /opt/wps-office-chroot/etc/resolv.conf
> 
> If you are using a 64-bit OS:
> - WPS will be directly installed with apt.
> - The total installation will take 1.3GB of space.
> - To run in a terminal: wps
> - If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, edit the menu button and get rid of the "firejail --net=none" part.
