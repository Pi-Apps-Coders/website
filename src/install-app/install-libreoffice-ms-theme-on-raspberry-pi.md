## <img src="/img/app-icons/Libreoffice MS theme/icon-64.png"> Libreoffice MS theme
> Make Libreoffice to look like Microsoft office - icon theme and tabbed interface.
> The icon theme was obtained from here: https://www.deviantart.com/charliecnr/art/Office-2013-theme-for-LibreOffice-512127527
> And the tabbed interface is a hidden feature within Libreoffice.
> Currently, the tabbed interface works for Calc, Impress, and Writer. Base and Math don't support it, and it doesn't display correctly on Draw for some reason.

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
Libreoffice MS theme will run on either PiOS 32-bit or 64-bit.
