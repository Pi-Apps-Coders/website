## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bullseye**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3 and the Pi 4.
Descent 1 will only run on PiOS 32-bit. Pi-Apps will not let you install Descent 1 on PiOS 64-bit.
