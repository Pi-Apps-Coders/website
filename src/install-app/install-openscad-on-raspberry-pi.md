> OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.

> Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
> the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
> OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
> perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.
> 
> OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
> a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
> and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
> full control over the modelling process and enables them to easily

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
OpenSCAD will run on either PiOS 32-bit or 64-bit.
