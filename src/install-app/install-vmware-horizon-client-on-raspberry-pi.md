> VMware Horizon Client allows your end users to connect to their VMware Horizon View VM from a device of choice.
> 
> The Horizon Client app communicates with the View Connection Server, which acts as a broker between the client device and View desktops. Users enter credentials into Horizon Client and the View Connection Server authenticates them and then finds their virtual desktops.
> 
> IT administrators can also use Horizon Client and the View Connection Server to deliver Microsoft Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) desktops and applications from an RDSH farm or to deliver VMware ThinApp applications within Horizon View.
> 
> To run: Menu -> Internet -> VMware Horizon Client
> To run in a terminal: vmware-view

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
**VMware Horizon Client will only run on PiOS 32-bit.** Pi-Apps will not let you install VMware Horizon Client on PiOS 64-bit.
