> BleachBit is a free and open-source disk space cleaner, privacy manager, and computer system optimizer. Not outdated like the APT repo's BleachBit.
> 
> Like CCleaner on Windows, BleachBit frees space by deleting unimportant files and helps maintain your privacy by deleting sensitive data. 
> And, just like CCleaner, there’s more you can do with BleachBit than just clicking a single button.
> 
> Better than free, BleachBit is open source.
> 
> Comparison to APT version:
> - Nicer GUI look
> - With Abort function
> - With many function not included in APT version (Shred path from clipboard,make chaff and etc)
> - Clean deeper
> - Official dark theme support
> - Support showing debug messages
> 
> To run: Menu -> Accessories -> BleachBit
> To run in a terminal: bleachbit
