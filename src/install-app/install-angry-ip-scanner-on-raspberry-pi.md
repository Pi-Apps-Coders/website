## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
**Angry IP scanner will only run on PiOS 64-bit.** Pi-Apps will not let you install Angry IP scanner on PiOS 32-bit.
