> Make Libreoffice to look like Microsoft office - icon theme and tabbed interface.
> The icon theme was obtained from here: https://www.deviantart.com/charliecnr/art/Office-2013-theme-for-LibreOffice-512127527
> And the tabbed interface is a hidden feature within Libreoffice.
> Currently, the tabbed interface works for Calc, Impress, and Writer. Base and Math don't support it, and it doesn't display correctly on Draw for some reason.
