## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
Timeshift will run on either PiOS 32-bit or 64-bit.
