# Install <img src="/img/app-icons/SolveSpace/icon-64.png" height=24> SolveSpace on Linux ARM Device

## <img src="/img/app-icons/SolveSpace/icon-64.png"> SolveSpace
> Free (GPLv3) parametric 3d CAD tool.
> This is a simpler and more beginner friendly alternative to FreeCAD. It has enough features to do everything most people need, with notable exceptions being chamfers and fillets.
> It runs quite well on Raspberry Pi hardware.
> Main features:
> - modeling 3d parts — draw with extrudes, revolves, helixes and Boolean (union / difference / intersection) operations
> - modeling 2d parts — draw the part as a single section, and export DXF, PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit
> - 3d-printed parts — export the STL or other triangle mesh expected by most 3d printers
> - preparing CAM data — export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine or laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for import into third-party CAM software for machining
> - mechanism design — use the constraint solver to simulate planar or spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints
> - plane and solid geometry — replace hand-solved trigonometry and spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing
> 
> To run: Menu -> Graphics -> SolveSpace
> To run in a terminal: solvespace
