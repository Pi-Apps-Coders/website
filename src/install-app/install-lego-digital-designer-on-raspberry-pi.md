> Play with virtual Lego blocks and create your own plans!
> This is Lego's official (discontinued) brick design program. With it, you can build your own sets within the editor and paint the pieces any color you wish.
> Afterwards, you can generate step-by-step building plans and print them out. Or you could place your creation into a desert background and take a picture of it to share with friends.
> 
> This program runs extremely well on RPi. The only problem I (Botspot) could find was the sound effects don't work.

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
**Lego Digital Designer will only run on PiOS 32-bit.** Pi-Apps will not let you install Lego Digital Designer on PiOS 64-bit.
