> Proper appearance theme for the Geany text editor.
> Geany's default color scheme looks horrible. Fortunately, this app will make it look good.
> By default, this will apply the "spyder-dark" theme, (Botspot's favorite!), but it will also install many other themes to try out as well. To switch themes in Geany: View -> Change Color Scheme.
