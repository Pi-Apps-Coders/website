> The Monero wallet software allows you to store your currency securely. Usually this requires downloading the whole blockchain (over 400GB for Bitcoin), but Monero wallet has "simple mode" which avoids taking up your disk space.

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
**Monero GUI will only run on PiOS 64-bit.** Pi-Apps will not let you install Monero GUI on PiOS 32-bit.
