## <img src="/img/app-icons/Minecraft Java Prism Launcher/icon-64.png"> Minecraft Java Prism Launcher
> Prism Launcher is an Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free redistributability.
> 
> Features of the launcher:
> - Microsoft, Mojang, and PC GamePass Account support
> - Curseforge Modrinth FTB ATLauncher and Technic Mod and Modpack browser and updater
> - Automatic Java 8/17/21 installation (when available) and selection
> - Fabric, Forge, and Quilt mod loading
> - Supports minecraft versions from the old beta/alphas and old snapshots all the way up the latest snapshots
> 
> Features NOT in this launcher (but available in others):
> - NONE
> 
> NOTE: The use of performance enhancing mods is highly encouraged, such as optifine with Optifabric and Fabric/Forge or Sodium/Lithium/Starlight Fabric Mods.
> 
> NOTE: Minecraft 1.17+ officially requires a graphics device capable of OpenGL 3.2+. On devices runnning MESA drivers without 3.2+ (eg: all Raspberry Pi models), this install script will OVERRIDE the reported version to 3.3. This currently allows (at the time of writing) up to 1.19.2 (with or without Sodium/Optifine) to function without issue on Raspberry Pi models but may not work across all non-OpenGL 3.2+ hardware and may not work on newer Minecraft and/or Mod versions. You have been warned.
> 
> NOTE: Minecraft 24w14a+ (snapshot of 1.20.5) officially requires Java 21 and a 64bit Operating System. Java 21 is not generally available on 32bit Operating Systems so expect to be unable to play 1.20.5+ on 32bit systems.
> 
> To run: Menu -> Games -> Prism Launcher
