# Install <img src="/img/app-icons/Wine (x64)/icon-64.png" height=24> Wine (x64) on Linux ARM Device

## <img src="/img/app-icons/Wine (x64)/icon-64.png"> Wine (x64)
> Run x86 and x64 Windows apps with a box64-emulated version x86/x64 wine-9.17 (WOW64 mode enabled).
> To run: wine path/to/file.exe
> To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
> Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.
> 
> Note: x86 32bit applications use the new Wine WOW64 mode. The WOW64 mode allows for running x86 Windows applications on x86_64 without any x86 Linux userspace.
> Note: This mode is experimental in Wine and Box64 support for x86 code still need some work. However, many applications already work.
> 
> Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
> 
> Need support with running a game or app with wine and box64? Ask it on the Pi Labs Discord: https://discord.gg/JKNQXprqUd
