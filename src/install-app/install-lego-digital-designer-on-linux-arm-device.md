> This is Lego's official (discontinued) brick design program. With it, you can build your own sets within the editor and paint the pieces any color you wish.
> Afterwards, you can generate step-by-step building plans and print them out. Or you could place your creation into a desert background and take a picture of it to share with friends.

> This program runs extremely well on RPi. The only problem I (Botspot) could find was the sound effects don't work.
