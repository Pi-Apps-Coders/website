Add a bit of color coding to the documentation for linux commands.
You may have used the man command before.
man grep
man sudo
man ffmpeg
These are the manuals for all your linux commands, but everything is black and white. This script adds a red color to the program flag options, and gives a green color to any underlined text in the document. Result: more easily readible and digestable manpages.

To customize the colors, go familiarize yourself with the shell color codes here: https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting
Then, as root, go edit this file: /usr/local/bin/man
```

OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
full control over the modelling process and enables them to easily
change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are
defined by configurable parameters.

----- Usage -----
Once Chiaki is running, you can enter the settings menu (top right) to configure general/stream settings to your liking. Note that stream quality options are limited depending on your console. To connect and use a controller with Chiaki, please refer to the Pi fork wiki.
In most cases, Chiaki will automatically detect your console if it's turned on. Otherwise, you can add it manually by pressing the "+" icon (top right) and entering your console's IP address.

To finalize the registration, two more parameters need to be set.
PSN AccountID: In a terminal, enter "python3 Chiaki/psn-account-id.py" and follow the instructions.
Registration PIN:
On a PS4, go to: Settings -> Remote Play -> Add Device;
On a PS5, go to: Settings -> System -> Remote Play -> Link Device.

You can now double-click your console in Chiaki's main window to start remote play!

GDLauncher is simple, yet powerful Minecraft launcher with a strong focus on the user experience. This is a CUSTOM BUILD of GDLauncher for ARM32/ARM64 support.

The Open Source version of GDLauncher has been discontinued by upstream GorillaDevs as of January 2023. As such, this launcher will receieve no further updates.

Although GDLauncher is currently functional, all users are encouraged to use Minecraft Java Prism Launcher (https://pi-apps.io/install-app/install-minecraft-java-prism-launcher-on-raspberry-pi/).
GDLauncher is heavy (high RAM and CPU usage) due to being built on the Electron (Chromium) framework.
By comparison, Prism Launmcher is very lightweight and has all the missing features and more from below.

Features of the launcher:
- Microsoft, Mojang, and PC GamePass Account support
- Curseforge and FTB Mod and Modpack browser and updater
- Automatic Java 8/17 installation
- Fabric and Forge mod loading

Features NOT in this launcher (but available in Prism Launcher):
- Modrinth ATLauncher and Technic Mod and Modpack browser and updater
- Quilt mod loading
- Old Snapshots

NOTE: The use of performance enhancing mods is highly encouraged, such as optifine with Optifabric and Fabric/Forge or Sodium/Lithium/Starlight Fabric Mods.

NOTE: Minecraft 1.17+ officially requires a graphics device capable of OpenGL 3.2+. On devices runnning MESA drivers without 3.2+ (eg: all Raspberry Pi models), this install script will OVERRIDE the reported version to 3.3. This currently allows (at the time of writing) up to 1.19.2 (with or without Sodium/Optifine) to function without issue on Raspberry Pi models but may not work across all non-OpenGL 3.2+ hardware and may not work on newer Minecraft and/or Mod versions. You have been warned.

NOTE: Minecraft 24w14a+ (snapshot of 1.20.5) officially requires Java 21 and a 64bit Operating System. Java 21 is not generally available on 32bit Operating Systems so expect to be unable to play 1.20.5+ on 32bit systems.

To run: Menu -> Games -> GDLauncher

theofficialgman's custom meta repo is used for arm32 and arm64 native libraries. (https://github.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm32 https://github.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm64)
This supports all currently released versions of minecraft.

Note: GDLauncher GitHub/Discord does NOT support this CUSTOM BUILD, any issues should be directed to the Pi-Apps Discord or Pi-Apps GitHub issues.

Ruffle is a open source Adobe Flash Player emulator aimed at having the best compatibility as the official Adobe Flash Player (which is proprietary, EOL and has many unpatched security vulnerabilities)

Ruffle is a constant work in progress, so except a lot of nigthly updates and bugs/broken features until a stable release in the future.

This will compile the latest branch from source which as of writing this is nightly-2025-03-08.

Raspberry Pi specific note: Ruffle defaults to the Vulkan rendering backend, which causes issues like graphical issues and break certain Flash content on the Pi's GPU. To solve this, switch to the OpenGL rendering backend which is more stable on the Pi's GPU.

To switch rendering backends:
Menu --> Preferences --> Graphics Backend (Default --> OpenGL)
Then restart the app and you should be good to go.

HTTrack is a free and easy-to-use offline browser utility.

It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system. 

This will also install WebHTTrack, which is a graphical version of HTTrack that uses a locally served website as a GUI.

To run HTTrack:
Run from Terminal: httrack

To run WebHTTrack (graphical version of HTTrack):

Open-source secure remote desktop connection software, better than AnyDesk or TeamViewer
RustDesk seems like the best choice and is one of the few that actually works well on Raspberry Pi. (Especially with Wayland)
This will install the server and viewer. You can connect to other RustDesk-enabled computers, or connect to this system from elsewhere. Connections can be made between two devices with access to the Internet, with no need for port forwarding or other changes to the network configuration. 
They even have a viewer online, in addition to phone and PC apps. You can use any device as a controlling viewer by going to to https://rustdesk.com/web

To run: Menu -> Internet -> RustDesk
To run in a terminal: rustdesk
The background service should start automatically on boot. To run it in a terminal: /usr/bin/rustdesk --service

Note: for faster speeds and higher security, consider setting up your own RustDesk self-hosted server.

On Raspberry Pi OS, Wayland can be disabled by running "sudo raspi-config" in a terminal and navigating to Advanced Options, where Wayland/X11 can be toggled.
Again, RustDesk is recommended. It's open source and works better.

Make the most of your browser.
This is a collection of improvements for various aspects of Chromium.
A window will appear with options. Feel free to pick and choose what you want, and uninstall this app to revert all changes.
Be sure to close Chromium and re-launch it for the changes to take effect.

Features:
- Dark mode for user interface
- Dark mode for all websites
- Change UI scale (make everything larger)
- Tab Previews (hover your mouse over a tab to see the page contents)
- Google Chrome Sync
- Widevine DRM support (for protected media like Netflix or Spotify)
- Performance Improvements (Faster loading and scrolling)
- Reduce writes to the SD card (Uses RAM for cache)

With the exception of Widevine, this script simply adds files to the /etc/chromium.d folder, most of which will add command-line flags to Chromium as it launches. Feel free to inspect the script to see how each of these features works.

Note: To enable Google Chrome Sync, first enable it here, then go to Chromium's account profile settings, enable "Allow Chromium sign-in", relaunch the browser, then you can login to Google and synchronize bookmarks, history, passwords, etc.

Speeds up web browsing thanks to cloud servers.
This web browser uses cloud servers to load websites for you, instead of making your system do it all. Result: a claimed 1600% browsing speed increase.
Please note that Puffin is a pretty bad browser now, and uses such an old Google Chrome that it fails to load many common websites correctly. Additionally, Puffin's cloud servers can probably see everything you are looking at, so try to avoid giving it any sensitive data.
Puffin is probably best used sparingly only on systems with low RAM, such as the Pi Zero 2 or Pi 3. It can also be useful for reaching websites forbidden by your local network, since browsing traffic is handled on Puffin's servers.

Also don't be surprised if we at Pi-Apps decide to remove Puffin in the future. But for now it still works on 64-bit ARM systems at least. (32-bit support broke in late 2024)

For new users: you first need to install Signal on a smartphone to set up your account. Then run Signal Desktop and it will show a QR code. Scan the QR code with the phone to authenticate Signal Desktop.
Important note: all messages sent and received BEFORE authorizing Signal Desktop will never appear in the message history on Signal Desktop. So if you want to use Signal Desktop, try to set it up sooner rather than later. To migrate to a new Linux OS and keep your message history, copy your "$HOME/.config/Signal Unofficial" folder to the new system.

All-in-one screen recording utility for wlroots Wayland compositors like Wayfire, LabWC and Sway.
Botspot Screen Recorder (BSR) makes it easy to record the screen on Wayland Pi OS. Without this, the only real option was to use the wf-recorder command-line tool, which was quite limited in features.
BSR does use wf-recorder in some modes, but it can also record the webcam and the screen at the same time in a "streaming gamer" style. The webcam feed is displayed as a window on the desktop to be captured with the rest of the screen, and it can be stretched and moved in real time. BSR also supports capturing the microphone and system audio both at once, so perfect for making any sort of Linux usage tutorials without needing to buy a physical HDMI capture card.
Of course, video encoding does use some CPU/GPU resources. There is no way around that, but BSR has been optimized as much as possible, also offering downscaling and framerate limiting to help reduce resource usage even further.

To run: Menu -> Sound & Video -> Botspot Screen Recorder
To run in a terminal: ~/.local/share/botspot-screen-recorder/screen-recorder.sh

If you are using Gnome or KDE plasma, this won't work. If you are using X11, this won't work.

Useful audio effects that are applied to all system sounds
Is that one video too quiet and you need the volume boosted? Or do you want to add some echo to your favorite music, or are your speakers set up backwards and you need to swap the left and right outputs?
With EasyEffects you can do that.

I (Botspot) have been using this for several months now and find it quite useful.
With a big sound system, the room would shake whenever a YouTube video had some low wind noise, and EasyEffects fixed that with the "Equalizer" plugin where low frequency sounds could be limited.
Also check out the "Autogain" plugin. It turns down the volume during loud portions and raises it when someone is talking quietly. Perfect for class recordings where the teacher always talks very quietly, but occasionally shouts or pounds on the desk, and you don't want to wake up the neighborhood.
There are 24 effects in total, each with many presets and parameters to fiddle with. Also, effects can be applied to system input sounds (microphones), so you could improve how your voice sounds for audio recordings and voice calls.

Feature-rich screen recorder for X11 and OpenGL
Simple Screen Recorder is, despite its name, an actually feature-rich screen recorder. The name reflects the fact that it is simple to use unlike many other free screen recording applications available. It can be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like interface.

It can record the entire screen or part of it directly.  The recording can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and codecs are supported. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.

It has a Qt-based graphical user interface.

Its complexity becomes apparent in its powerful features. It allows one to record X11 screen areas and fullscreen OpenGL applications including sound supporting both ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK and OSS. It uses libavformat to encode the recorded material into a variety of video formats. Scaling the recorded video is possible as well as configuring the encoding quality for the codec chosen directly from the user interface.

Record audio from the microphone
This is a very simple app but it gets the job done easier than a more complicated choice such as VLC or Audacity.
You have to plug in an audio input device such as a webcam or USB microphone or USB sound card, then make sure it is set as default by right-clicking on the microphone icon on your taskbar.

To run: Menu -> Sound & Video -> Sound Recorder
To run in a terminal: gnome-sound-recorder

Tips:
1. In testing, the recorded audio quality was just a loud buzzing sound and impossible to hear anything else. If this happens to you, try changing the Audio Channel to Mono instead of Stereo.
2. You are supposed to leave the recorded audio in the app, and to actually save the audio somewhere, you are supposed to "export" it to a folder of your choice. But this is extra work and duplicates the data for no good reason, so here is the folder for saved recordings: ~/.local/share/org.gnome.SoundRecorder

This is a Chinese clone of Microsoft Office.
It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, a PDF viewer, and a web browser. It appears to be free software and you don't need to create an account to use it.
Compared to LibreOffice, WPS Office runs faster, looks better, and seems to be more stable.

This script will prevent the program from connecting to the Internet, just in case it contains telemetry or spyware.

To run: Menu -> Office -> WPS Office
To run in a terminal: it depends! Please read the information below.

This app installs differently, depending on if you are using a 32-bit OS or a 64-bit OS.
If you are using a 32-bit OS:
- You will have to enable the 64-bit kernel. Don't worry, enabling it will not harm your OS - you probably won't even notice.
- A 64-bit Debian Bullseye chroot will be created. (/opt/wps-office-chroot)
- The total installation will take 2.1GB of space.
- To run in a terminal: schroot -c wps-office-chroot -- wps
- If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, then run this command: sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /opt/wps-office-chroot/etc/resolv.conf

If you are using a 64-bit OS:
- WPS will be directly installed with apt.
- The total installation will take 1.3GB of space.
- To run in a terminal: wps
- If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, edit the menu button and get rid of the "firejail --net=none" part.

Of course Pi-Apps lets you download more RAM!
Have you ever been using your Raspberry Pi when the screen froze? Most likely, your system ran out of RAM.
On default Raspbian, freezes happen easily and suddenly. When the RAM fills up, the entire system becomes unresponsive. Many people think the only solution is to buy a Pi with more RAM, but THAT'S NOT TRUE and this app proves it.

This app uses ZRAM to increase the capacity of your RAM. ZRAM is a kernel module to compress data on-the-fly and store it in RAM. It has all sorts of uses, but it can be an extremely performant Swap drive with the right tweaks.

Some types of data compress better than others. On average, the ZSTD algorithm reaches a 3:1 compression-ratio, but in some cases it can approach 5:1! When used as Swap, this means that theoretically, one RAM chip can store 5 times as much memory! While real-world loads are unlikely to be compressible that much, the results are still impressive. In a recent test, Chromium was instructed to open 200 tabs. (mostly youtube videos)
When everything finished loading, Chromium had consumed 7GB of RAM. However, this test was performed on a Raspberry Pi 4 with only 4GB of RAM! Without ZRAM, the screen would have frozen within seconds. But with ZRAM, the system was still very responsive.

What does this app do?
- This app will disable the default Swapfile. (By default, RPiOS comes with a pitiful 100MB swapfile that does barely anything) Disabling Swap reduces the number of writes to the SD card, boosting performance while increasing its lifetime.
- This app will setup ZRAM to extend the usable RAM, when necessary. How much ZRAM? It's calculated based on a 4:1 ratio of your devices available RAM. On a 1GB Pi, there will be 4GB of ZRAM; on a 4GB Pi there will be 16GB of ZRAM. Remember: this relies on compressing data, so some situations may not be able to reach the full 4:1 compression-ratio.
- This app will adjust a few kernel paremeters to optimize RAM usage.
- Remember how ZRAM can be used for other things too? This app will also set up some high speed data storage using ZRAM. It's perfect for managing large files temporarily, without filling up your SD card. This is similar to a RAMdisk, but it doesn't use the RAM as quickly. You can access this storage by going to the new /zram folder.
Of course, uninstalling this app will revert everything back to how it was.

How do I know if it's working? There are a few ways to check.
- You can run the htop command to see RAM and Swap usage. Htop will refresh itself every second, just like the Task Manager.
- You can install Conky from Pi-Apps. This will display the RAM and Swap usage on the desktop. Conky refreshes twice every second.
- To see more detailed ZRAM information and statistics, run the zramctl command.

What about Novaspirit Tech's popular ZRAM tutorial from a few years ago? Is this app better? Yes. First, Novaspirit created four swapdisks, while only one is necessary. Also, he used LZ4 compression, while this app uses the new ZSTD compression algorithm. (ZSTD is slightly slower than LZ4, but its compression ratio is far better) Also, he didn't tweak any kernel parameters, severaly limiting ZRAM's effectiveness.

Overall, this app is designed to get the most out of ZRAM. Even if your Pi never uses all available RAM, installing this app will unlock more space for file-caching, thereby improving performance while reducing writes to the SD card.

Run LLMs like ChatGPT locally without the Internet
ChatGPT is a large language AI model that requires several GPUs to run, but other AI models are a lot smaller. Some have been compressed enough to fit in 8GB of RAM, meaning that you could ask a local AI questions without any internet connection. On a low-power computer, the writing speed will be slow, and the accuracy is worse than larger cloud models, but it is still useful in situations where you need some information and have high privacy standards or have no Internet connection.

I (Botspot) have optimized the install script here on Pi-Apps to do a lot more then just install the Ollama command-line tool. Installing Ollama from Pi-Apps will:
1. Install Ollama and set it to run with a low priority, to help with system responsiveness.
2. Pre-download the best 2 LLMs: Codellama:7b and Phi3:mini. Codellama is geared towards programming - perfect for getting help with linux commands or writing code. Phi3 is the best general-purpose ChatGPT equivalent I could find that runs decently.
3. This also installs my fork of a simple Python-based GUI that you can run from the menu. It is easier to navigate and has more features than the default command-line interface.

Feel free to search for more LLMs here: https://ollama.com/library
One you may want to try out is deepseek-r1:8b or llama3. Once you know the name of a model you want, just paste it into the download box in Ollama GUI's Settings.

NOTE: The pre-included models use about 6-7 GB of RAM. To prevent the screen from freezing up, make sure your device has that much available RAM before running this. It is recommended to close web browsers especially, and to install the More RAM app from Pi-Apps first, to give you a bit more buffer room. If your screen does freeze, don't panic, ollama usually times out and removes the model from RAM in about 5 minutes.

To run: Menu -> Education -> Ollama GUI

Pi-apps terminal is a script that lets you use pi-apps from the terminal, its written in bash.
It has all the commands you will ever need:
'install' - install a app available in pi-apps.
'remove' - uninstall a app installed by pi-apps (uninstall also works).
'multi-install' - install multiple apps.
'multi-remove' - uninstall multiple apps (multi-uninstall also works).
'list-all' - list all the apps in pi-apps (note that this will also list apps that are not available for your OS).
'list-installed' - list all the apps installed by pi-apps.
'list-uninstalled' - list all the uninstalled apps.
'list-corrupted' - list all the corrupted apps.
'search' - usage: search "search-term". search a app available in pi-apps (note that this will show results from the description of the 'apps as well as their name).
'website' - usage: website "app-name". print the website of a app available in pi-apps.
'update' - update all pi-apps components.
'update-apps' - update all pi-apps apps only.
'gui' - launch pi-apps regularly.

and it makes life easier by eliminating the use of quotes for apps with a space in their name (unless you are using 'multi-install' or 'multi-uninstall').

Store Monero cryptocurrency with Feather Wallet - better experience than Monero GUI
Monero is a privacy currency, allowing easy money transfers to others without oppresive governments, hackers, or foreign adversaries knowing how much you sent or to whom.
Feather wallet allows you to store your currency securely. Usually this requires downloading the whole blockchain (Around 60gb for a pruned node), but Feather Wallet allows you to connect to remote nodes and will fetch the blockchain data very fast so you can get transacting quickly. It will check a list of nodes speed and pick the fastest one. Chances are if you have used the offical Monero GUI wallet you have experienced crashes, and sometimes annoying bugs. If you want a less buggy, more simple wallet Feather wallet is for you! It just works....

To run in a terminal: xmrig
This is assuming you set up the config file. Otherwise, you can add flags like this: 
xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10032 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

If you use the MoneroOcean pool, you can view the miner's performance by visiting https://moneroocean.stream

NOTE:
This is not a Bitcoin miner! Most XMRig users mine Monero - a cryptocurrency with exceptional privacy, security, and decentralization measures.
Monero is probably the best currency for PC mining, as its mining algorithm is specifically designed to thwart specialized mining equipment.

Run Windows 11 in a high-speed virtual machine on Linux
BVM is a virtual machine optimized for Windows 11 on ARM hardware like Raspberry Pi. It downloads, converts, configures, installs, and debloats the OS automatically, and all that's needed from you is to watch and wait patiently.
The VM has copy and paste transfer support, audio and internet passthrough (including Wi-Fi btw), file synchronization, and optimized graphics. It runs about as fast as Windows installed on real hardware, but with more drivers and better flexibility.

In case that's not enough, BVM makes Windows 11 install 100% automatically, it removes Microsoft's bloatware apps and advertising, it disables the Microsoft account requirement, and it makes a few more tweaks to reduce RAM usage to around 900 MB on standby.
Highly recommended: Go install the More RAM app from Pi-Apps, to help avoid freezes due to low available RAM. It makes a big difference, especially with devices having 4GB of RAM or less.

To run the simplified graphical interface: Menu -> Office -> Botspot Virtual Machine
To see the help options for the full command-line interface: ~/.local/share/bvm/bvm help

NOTE: This software is in BETA. It was released just a few days ago and may have bugs. You are expected to report all issues and ask questions by clicking on the github.com link at the top of this window, then click on the Issues tab.

Box64 lets you run x86_64 Linux programs (such as games) on non-x86_64 Linux systems, like ARM (host system needs to be 64bit little-endian).

Because Box64 uses the native versions of some "system" libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, OpenGL, and Vulkan, it's easy to integrate and use with most applications, and performance can be surprisingly high in many cases.

ARM64 ONLY
```
Hangover runs simple Win64 and Win32 applications on arm64 Linux. Only the application is emulated instead of a whole Wine installation.

Hangover can be used in place of the Wine app on Pi-Apps. It may be worth trying this to see if something that did not run on the emulated Wine will run here.
For example, one app (tested by Botspot) failed to launch the installer on emulated Wine (x64), got stuck installing on Hangover with the Box64 emulator, and successfully installed with the FEX emulator selected. (see how to select an emulator below)

If you have Wine installed already, clicking Install here will uninstall Wine first. Do note that installed applications and configuration left over from Wine in ~/.wine will need to be removed or renamed, as it appears Hangover cannot import it.

Examples on how to run:
$ wine your_x86_64_application.exe # Uses FEX for 64-bit apps
$ wine your_x86_application.exe # To use Box64 for 32-bit apps
$ HODLL=libwow64fex.dll wine your_x86_application.exe # To use FEX for 32-bit apps
$ HODLL=xtajit.dll taskset -c 1 wine your_x86_application.exe # To use QEMU for 32-bit apps (limited to 1 core to workaround a bug)

Note: x86 32bit applications use the new Wine WOW64 mode. The WOW64 mode allows for running x86 Windows applications on x86_64 without any x86 Linux userspace.
Note: This mode is experimental in Wine and Box64 support for x86 code still need some work. However, many applications already work.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
