# Feedback and Bugs

We really appreciate all kinds of feedback from our community. If you've run into a bug while using Pi-Apps, or if you'd like to suggest a new app, please head over to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues) page and make a post.

**NOTE:** If you're reporting a bug, please do have a good look through the list of issues posted by other users. It may have already been reported by someone else.

Once you're done there, why don't you come and [join us](https://pi-apps.io/#get-involved) on our Discord server?
